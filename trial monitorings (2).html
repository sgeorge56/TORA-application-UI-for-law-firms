<hr>
<p>  POSSIBLE ISSUES TO EXAMINE WHEN MONITORING TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>
<ul class ="a" style = "list-style-type: square;">
 <p>Right to a public hearing Check whether: </p>
 
<li>	A trial schedule is compiled and, if it is, whether it accurately depicts all hearings and is placed in public view (e</li>g</li>, on an announcement board) or is easily accessible to the public</li>
<li>	There is a culture among judges of accepting in the courtroom members of the public with no di-rect interest in the proceedings, and whether attendance at proceedings is allowed without bias as to the affinity of the public with one party or another</li>
<li>	The courtroom assigned to a specific hearing is too small relative to the expected public interest and despite the fact that a larger courtroom could have been allocated</li>
<li>	The hearing takes place in the office of the judge, without due reason</li>
<li>	There are unreasonable restrictions placed on the public entering the courtroom after the pro-ceedings are in session</li>
<li>	Media are permitted to enter a courtroom and whether any permission required is denied with-out explanation</li>
<li>	The court strikes a case-by-case balance of interests in declaring a trial or hearing closed, and whether it considers other less stringent measures to protect the concerned interests</li>
<li>	Other such measures, less stringent than declaring the hearing closed, are available in the legal system e.g the assignment of pseudonyms or testimony provided by video-link as alternative protective measures for vulnerable witnesses)</li>
 Right to a competent, independent and impartial court</li> Check whether:
<li>	There are any objective or perception-based indicators that judges assigned to a case do not have the legal qualifications to try them (e</li>g</li>, a minor-offence court judge being assigned to a panel on a war crimes case)</li>
<li>	A diversity of competent judges is promoted, thus avoiding perceptions that qualified persons of different genders, ethnic or religious backgrounds are deliberately excluded from administering justice in specific cases</li>
<li>	The judges assigned to a specific case are appointed on the basis of an objective system - such as a lottery - and, if random assignment is overridden, that this is done on the basis of a reasoned decision</li>
<li>	Judges are enabled by the system to decide independently on a matter, or whether they consider themselves bound by external factors, (e</li>g</li>, a judge refusing to review an administrative instruc-tion or considering her/himself bound by a detention order imposed by a foreign court or con-sidering her/himself unable to review well-grounded suspicion for the continuation of pre-trial detention)</li>
<li>	Judges treat favourably or more cordially one party in relation to another in their communica-tion, or whether trial judges or higher level judges publicly express an opinion that jeopardizes the presumption of innocence in a case</li>
<li>	Judges adjudicating a case are continuously present during the trial and the bench is properly composed</li>
<li>	There have been threatening statements made against the judiciary by political actors or parties to the proceedings in relation to the outcome of a case</li>
<li>	Allegations of corruption or undue influence on the judges of a case are made by parties or there is such a perception of lack of integrity among the public</li>
<li>	The court appears not to take due notice of the arguments or proposals made by the defence or prosecution, or rejects them without due justification</li>
<li>	The decisions and judgements of the court contain justifications as to the evidence or law they have considered in reaching them</li>
<li>	Evidence not presented in court is taken into consideration in reaching a verdict (also connected to the right to oral proceedings and the right to a public trial)</li>
<li>    The system provides judges with security of tenure and decent compensation and 
the evaluation of judges takes into account factors that limit their independence 
and has an impact on their conduct e.g. giving negative evaluations of judges who express minority opinions)</li></ul>
<p>Right to be present at trial and right to defend oneself. Check whether:</p>
<ul class ="a" style = "list-style-type: square;">

<li>The court has duly summoned a defendant for proceedings, and whether defendants tried in ab-sentia have a real opportunity to challenge verdicts reached in their absence</li> 
<li>A defendant removed temporarily from proceedings is represented by counsel and informed about what took place in her/his absence</li>
<li>The accused is given a real opportunity to present evidence in her/his favour, and whether s/he has access to evidentiary material, especially if s/he so requests</li>
<li>There are claims or indicators suggesting that the prosecution has suppressed exonerating evidence</li>
<li>A defendant's testimony has allegedly been extracted under pressure, the defendant claims to have received threats aimed at preventing her/him from presenting a defence, or the defendant is alleged to have been pressured into covering up other co-perpetrators, and whether such alle-gations are properly investigated</li>
<li>The defendant has a real opportunity to review the record of any testimony s/he provides and signs</li>
<li>The defendant has adequate time to prepare a defence against evidence presented by the prose-cution or gathered by the court and Witnesses called by the defence are pressured not to testify</li></ul>
